I have over 15 years of professional experience contributing and leading the
 implementations of technical solutions and the development of technical
 products. I have both started my own company and have had the chance to
 further progress my career in an international setting.

experiences to increase systems quality in competitive and demanding
environments. I gain tremendous professional satisfaction leading companies
and people through difficult challenges and opportunities ensuring their
goals are achieved in an efficient and sustainable manner.
