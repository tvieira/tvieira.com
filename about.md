## About me

Father of 2 (girl and boy), [Open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) advocate,
[pythonista](https://en.wikipedia
.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29), linux nerd,
coffee-lover, information security paranoid + skeptical
inquirer, and student pilot.

I have over 19 years of professional experience contributing and leading the implementations of technical solutions and the development of technology products. I have both started my own company and have had the chance to further progress my career in an international setting.

I continuously apply the knowledge acquired through my professional experiences to increase systems quality in very competitive and demanding environments. I gain tremendous professional satisfaction leading companies and people through difficult challenges and opportunities ensuring their goals are achieved in an efficient and sustainable manner.

I'm a software engineer and I have extensive experience on software engineering and IT systems operations. The tools, languages, and frameworks I've been using in most recent years are: python, C, Golang, Ansible, linux hardening, configuration and troubleshooting (apache httpd, nginx, samba, NFS, email, DNS), packaging (RPM, Distutils), Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), Flask, Django, Red Hat OpenShift (OKD), Istio (composing and deploying service mesh), Kubernetes, KVM (virtualization tools) and Docker for micro-services and API development.

## Education and certifications

Education is very important to me, and I've been constantly updating my skills by learning and practicing new things. Here it is a list of my most valuable education achievements:

* [PgDip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_diploma#England
.2C_Wales_and_Scotland) in [Software and System Security](http://www.cs.ox.ac
.uk/softeng/security/) from University of Oxford
* [BSc (Hons)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science#Brazil) in Computer Science from [Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais](http://www.pucpcaldas.br/)
* [Empretec (UNCTAD)](http://empretec.unctad.org/) Certified
* [RHCA - Red Hat Certified Architect in Infrastructure, Level V](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/certification/verify/?certId=160-116-729)
* [CTFL - Certified Tester Foundation Level](https://www.astqb.org/sections/list-of-certified-testers.php)

## Professional experience

I spent many years working on technology startups, and I have experience across different industries such as: telecomm, banking, independent software vendor, information service providers, media and printing. Today, my strongest skills are on:

* Developing web applications (web services, microservices, api, content management systems)
* Developing with Python, Flask, and Django
* Administrating linux systems and infrastructure
* Building continuous delivery (CDR), continuous deployment (CD) and continuous integration (CI) solutions
* Practicing agile devops processes and automation
* Engineering quality processes throughout the software life-cycle

During my career I had experience with the following areas:

* Development with C, Python, Golang and Javascript
* Software architecture (high availability, scalable web applications, component architecture, service oriented architecture, API design)
* Build and Release systems
* Infosec risk analysis and management
* Software and systems automation
* Configuration management ([Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [Puppet](https://puppet.com/))
* Linux operating systems, applications and utilities
* Systems monitoring and troubleshooting

I currently lead the quality engineering efforts for the [OpenShift Service Mesh](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/service_mesh/service_mesh_arch/understanding-ossm.html) (Istio, Kiali and Jaeger) at Red Hat. The work includes setting up and maintaining a continuous integration & continuous deployment infrastructure, coordinate testing efforts with adjacent teams, and managing tests & release planning. I also develop tests in all levels: unit, component, integration, interoperability and acceptance testing.

Along side mu technologist career, I am a coffee enthusiast. I was previously trained in coffee roasting, cupping and brewing at the [London School of Coffee](http://www.londonschoolofcoffee.com/). I also enrolled in a private pilot training at at the [East Coast Aero Club](http://eastcoastaeroclub.com/), and in the past year I've been flying single-engine aircrafts across the New England region.
